# Parallel-Implementation-of-Advanced-Matrix-Operations-for-Machine-Learning-using-MPI
This project explores the use of MPI for parallelizing advanced matrix operations that are fundamental to machine learning algorithms. The implementation will include operations such as matrix multiplication, if possible other advanced matrix operations such as covariance matrix computation, and eigenvalue decomposition (used in PCA).

1. Problem Statement
Machine learning algorithms rely heavily on matrix operations such as multiplication, addition, and inversion. However, as dataset sizes grow, these operations become computationally expensive and slow down training and inference.
Traditional sequential algorithms:
•	Do not scale well with large datasets.
•	Lead to high execution time and low resource utilization.
Parallel computing, particularly using MPI (Message Passing Interface), provides a way to distribute computation across processors to significantly improve performance and scalability. The project aims to implement parallel matrix operations using MPI for machine learning workloads.
2. Project Objectives
•	Implement parallel matrix multiplication using MPI.
•	Demonstrate how parallel processing accelerates ML computations.
•	Analyze performance gains compared to sequential execution.
•	Ensure scalability with increasing matrix sizes and processor counts.
•	Explore manager–worker paradigm for computation distribution.
3. Proposed Solution
•	Use MPI to parallelize matrix operations (starting with multiplication).
•	Employ Manager (Rank 0) as coordinator:
•	Initialize & distribute data.
•	Collect results.
•	Worker processors (Rank > 0):
•	Perform matrix multiplication for their assigned row chunks.
•	Collect timing results to measure speedup and efficiency.
4. Project Scope
•	Phase 1: Implement baseline sequential matrix multiplication in C.
•	Phase 2: Integrate MPI for matrix multiplication.
•	Phase 3: Analyze performance with different process counts & matrix sizes.
•	Future Scope:
•	Extend to other matrix operations (inversion, decomposition, factorizations).
•	Explore GPU–MPI hybrid solutions.
•	Apply to ML model training pipelines (PCA, neural networks, etc.).
5. Methodology
1.	Design Algorithm: Divide matrices, assign subsets to MPI workers.
2.	Implementation: C with MPI (MPI_Send, MPI_Recv, etc.).
3.	Testing: Verify correctness with small matrices, compare with sequential.
4.	Performance Evaluation: Measure runtime vs:
•	Number of processors.
•	Matrix size (N up to 512+ if possible).
5.	Analysis: Plot scaling efficiency and bottlenecks (communication overhead).
